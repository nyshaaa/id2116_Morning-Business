   <h1>HUANG ANQI</h1>

   <p>Born in Nanjing, China, raised in Singapore, 
     she is currently studying her second year in Industrial Design in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Art has been part of her life since she could hold a pen.
At the age of five, she stared her first Art lesson.
â€‹Soon, she is exposed to various on-paper medias.
However, due to school, she had to stop art for a couple years.
In 2016, high school gave her an opportunity to take up Art in school. She realize that Art is what she really wants. Moving on from traditional art medians, she ventured into sculpting, abstract calligraphy and photography.
