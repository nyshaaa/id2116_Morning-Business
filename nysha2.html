             <h1>hello there, i'm nysha!</h1>
                <p>I'm a budding industrial designer currently based in Singapore. 
                    <br>I have an interest in finding methods to create seamless systems 
                    in human-centred design. </br> With the current throw-away culture we have,
                    my position as a designer has developed my stance to<br> always make 
                    good things that last.</br> I love illustrating in my free time and documenting my travels through 
                    drawings. Currently, I am on a quest to find the perfect cereal bowl.
