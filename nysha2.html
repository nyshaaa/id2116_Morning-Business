             <h1>hello there, i'm nysha!</h1>
                <p>I'm a budding industrial designer currently based in Singapore. 
                    <br>I have an interest in finding methods to create seamless systems
                    <br>in human-centred design.With the current throw-away culture we </br>have,
                    my position as a designer has developed my stance to always <br> make 
                    good things that last. I love illustrating in my free time and <br>documenting my travels through 
                    drawings. 
                    <br>Currently, I am on a quest to find the perfect cereal bowl. 
                    My pal <a href="https://nyshaaa.github.io/id2116_Morning-Business/anqi.html">Anqi</a></br> and I have collaborated to create the most exciting Morning Business. <br>Check it out <a href="https://nyshaaa.github.io/id2116_Morning-Business/morning_business.html">here</a>!</p>
